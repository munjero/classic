subtitle: Is Ethereum Classic Vulnerable to Parity Multisig Hack?
---

Parity sufferred from two vulnerability exploits for its multisig
wallet implementation. The first one happened on [July
19th](https://blog.ethcore.io/the-multi-sig-hack-a-postmortem/), and
the second one happened on [November
7th](https://paritytech.io/blog/security-alert.html). Both caused
serious loss for its users.

## Is Ethereum Classic Affected?

> Does the Parity multisig hack affect the Ethereum Classic
> blockchain?

No. Neither the July 19th hack nor the November 7th hack affects the
Ethereum Classic blockchain.

The Parity multisig wallet deployment script can be found starting
from [L179 in this
file](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/blob/v1.8.2/js/src/modals/CreateWallet/createWalletStore.js#L179). It
uses the so-called "Parity Registry" to lookup the [wallet library
registry
key](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/blob/v1.8.2/js/src/contracts/code/wallet.js#L28)
`walletLibrary.v.2`. On Ethereum, this lookup will get you a
vulnerable wallet library address. In this case, it continues to
deploy the [wallet
contract](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/blob/v1.8.2/js/src/contracts/code/wallet.js#L24)
using it, and resulted in a vulnerable multisig wallet. On Ethereum
Classic, however, the wallet library is not deployed and lookup
`walletLibrary.v.2` would return nothing. In this case, the
[deployment
code](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/blob/v1.8.2/js/src/modals/CreateWallet/createWalletStore.js#L216)
continues to deploy another ["full"
version](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/blob/v1.8.2/js/src/contracts/code/wallet.js#L32)
of the multisig wallet. The full version is not affected by the wallet
library vulnerability. As a result, no matter when you deployed your
multisig contract on the Ethereum Classic chain, it is not affected by
any of the two Parity mutlisig hack.

The intention of using a wallet library is to save contract creation
gas. By deploying less code, the transaction of deployment costs
less. If you compare the multisig wallet deployment gas cost in
Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, Ethereum Classic can be a little
higher. This, however, saved Ethereum Classic users from two exploits.

We should note that a blockchain can only be as safe as the community
that uses it. Ethereum Classic is lucky this time not being
affected. We should stay cautious, however, and for all code for the
blockchain, having decent code review and security audit is important.
